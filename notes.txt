### NOTES ###

Thoughts:
	- Reduce down the unnecessary functions and group together checks
	- Work out how to link in the jQuery and where
	- Force the checks to the content scripts if possible
	- work out how to parse current and next urls in jQuery/javascript
	- work out if we have to detach from a tab?
	- shrink script
	- work out why not registering new event on page change
